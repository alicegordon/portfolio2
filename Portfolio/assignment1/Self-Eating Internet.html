<h1>Chronically Not Actually Online</h1>

<h2>Alice Gordon September 18, 2024</h2>

<main> Kate Wagner's essay "404 Page Not Found," reflected on her interactions with the internet through her life as a millennial witnessing the evolution of what being online really means. Beginning with her first venture onto AltaVista then into Neopets, Myspace, Facebook, and Instagram, Wagner examined how the larger her presence became online, the more it disappeared into the ether only to be commodified as "lo–res, imperfect, and entirely decontextualized" nostalgia.  

    <p>Early interfaces were the most personal and personalized with odes to secret crushes hidden with white text on Myspace on a custom skull patterned background. Because these websites were wholly anecdotal, they aren't held in high regard by those looking for a profit. Saving relics of Web 1.0 relied on amateur archivists to rescue everything from "gifs, images, and backgrounds...writing styles and layouts to the language they used to communicate," narrowly missing a proverbial burning of Library of Alexandria. </p>  

    <p>Wagner compared the idea of Web 1.0 to Web 2.0, one that's more akin to what Generation Z and Generation Alpha has grown up with. I am a "cusper," born in 1999, I remember what it was like to live my life without a cell phone on my person, learned code to customize mine and my friend’s Tumblr blogs, but I still have TikTok on my phone and only really remember Myspace because my babysitter had gotten in trouble for creating an account after her mom told her no. I had a computer room growing up and remember when the internet was a unmoving entity, one that had to be accessed rather than available at any given time on my phone.</p>  

    <p>As smartphones have become a staple of daily life, applications replaced websites. While the phrase "chronically online" is used thousands of times daily on Twitter or Instagram, these users aren’t actually online. When websites failed to adapt at the same rate as social media companies, the unique–ness of Web 1.0 was left for limited agency and "restricted by the proprietary designs of a small handful of companies." Because apps are inherently in competition with one another for users, ad revenue, etc., the universality and discovery of random websites disappeared. With most people accessing websites through a smartphone browser, all websites must be compatible for a desktop screen and smartphone screen, making the unique–ness and messiness of Web 1.0 impossible. The easiest way to achieve this compatibility by making websites "flat" and "highly minimalistic."</p>

    <p>Much like Wagner, I am nostalgic for the past internet. I don’t want to be on my phone as much as I am, but it feels like a requirement. While this nostalgia is real, it's also bolstered by its profitability. When Wagner described adding stickers to her Instagram story, those stickers are only available because the reference to the past makes money for the app and its parent company, Facebook. As Wagner described the importance of Vaporwave as the nostalgia turning point, I remembered the aesthetic booming on Tumblr with pastel colors, Windows 95 backgrounds, pictures of Florida malls bustling with teenagers, and even the Geocities gifs.  Often mixed with grunge aesthetics with chunky Doc Marten combat boots, cigarette cartons covered in handwritten Nirvana lyrics, American Apparel photoshoots, and bleached hair with a layer of fading Voodoo Blue Manic Panic. Not only is it interesting to reflect on what these trend revivals meant, but the way they were intertwined without even being originally related to each other is fascinating. If Vaporwave existed as a utopian vision of the internet, grunge aesthetics gave into the sadness and intermeshing of companies commodifying what their users are creating. There is a reason in my list of Vaporwave memories there are no "brands" to speak of (outside of Windows), but in my list for grunge aesthetics, it's cluttered with brands, even Nirvana acting as a brand divorced from their music, but as a simple reference point to summarize and squash the entirety of the early 90s. Wagner described these trend revivals, although in her case she's speaking strictly about Vaporwave, it was like hitting "Save" instead of "Save As," the resurgence of these trends was a version of time that never existed, "an overwritten file, a copy, but one for which no original exists."</p>
